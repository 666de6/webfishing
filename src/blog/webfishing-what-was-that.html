      Hey fellow WEBFISHING players! As a veteran angler who's spent countless hours in this amazing game, I want to share something fascinating about one of the game's most intriguing mysteries - the "What Was That?" message. If you've ever seen this green text pop up in your chat and wondered what it means, you're in for a treat!
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Mystery Behind the Message</h2>
    <div class="">
      <p class="mb-4">
        Picture this: you're peacefully fishing, enjoying the serene environment, when suddenly a mysterious green message appears saying "What Was That?" The first time I saw it, I was just as confused as you might be. But here's the exciting part - it's actually the game's way of telling you something extraordinary is about to happen!
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Does It Mean?</h2>
    <div class="">
      <p class="mb-4">
        When you see this message, it means a Meteor has just spawned somewhere in your game world! Yes, you heard that right - a METEOR! But here's the catch - you only have 60 seconds to find it. Look up at the sky and follow the smoke trail to locate where it landed.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Pro tip: If you're serious about catching what the meteor brings, I'd recommend playing in single-player mode. While the meteor appears for everyone in multiplayer, only one player can claim the prize!
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The UFO Connection</h2>
    <div class="">
      <p class="mb-4">
        Once you find where the meteor landed (look for a brown circle in any water body - ponds, lakes, rivers, or the ocean), this is where things get really interesting. Cast your line into that brown area, and you might just catch something out of this world - literally!
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The most exciting catch? The Unidentified Fish Object (UFO)! It's one of the game's most unique catches, featuring a rather peculiar dog-faced appearance. Trust me, it's one of those catches that will make you do a double-take!
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Tips for Success</h2>
    <div class="">
      <ul class="list-inside list-disc flex flex-col ga">
        <li>Stay alert for the green "What Was That?" message</li>
        <li>Immediately look to the sky for smoke trails</li>
        <li>Act fast - you only have 60 seconds!</li>
        <li>Look for brown circles in any water body</li>
        <li>Consider playing in single-player mode for better chances</li>
      </ul>

        This mysterious message is just one of the many quirky and fun elements that make WEBFISHING such a special game. It adds an element of excitement and unpredictability to what might otherwise be a calm fishing experience. Every time I see that green text now, I get a rush of excitement knowing there's a chance to add another UFO to my collection!
